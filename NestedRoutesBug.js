In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deep within the route hierarchy.  If the parent routes don't have matching parameters in their path, the nested component might receive `undefined` for expected parameters. This often leads to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, particularly when attempting to access the parameter values directly without proper null or undefined checks.
